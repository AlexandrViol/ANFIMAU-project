        <h3>
          Information about the responsible party (referred to as the
          “controller” in the GDPR)
        </h3>
        <p>The data processing controller on this website is:</p>
        <p>
          Anfimau Industry Solutions GmbH <br />
          Mergenthalerallee 15-21 65760 Eschborn, Deutschland<br />
          <br />
          Geschäftsführer: Mikhail Anfimau
        </p>
        <p>
          Phone: +4915140477169<br />
          E-mail: datenschutz@anfimau.de
        </p>
        <p>
          The controller is the natural person or legal entity that
          single-handedly or jointly with others makes decisions as to the
          purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g.,
          names, e-mail addresses, etc.).
        </p>
        <h3>Storage duration</h3>
        <p>
          Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this
          privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the
          purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a
          justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data
          processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally
          permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or
          commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion
          will take place after these reasons cease to apply.
        </p>
        <h3>
          General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this
          website
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal
          data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if
          special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1)
          DSGVO. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal
          data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49
          (1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the
          access to information in your end device (e.g., via device
          fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on § 25 (1)
          TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is
          required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation
          of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art.
          6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, if your data is required for the
          fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art.
          6(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on
          the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
          Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is
          provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Information on data transfer to the USA and other non-EU countries
        </h3>
        <p>
          Among other things, we use tools of companies domiciled in the United
          States or other from a data protection perspective non-secure non-EU
          countries. If these tools are active, your personal data may
          potentially be transferred to these non-EU countries and may be
          processed there. We must point out that in these countries, a data
          protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be
          guaranteed. For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate to
          release personal data to the security agencies and you as the data
          subject do not have any litigation options to defend yourself in
          court. Hence, it cannot be ruled out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the
          Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive your
          personal data for surveillance purposes. We have no control over these
          processing activities.
        </p>
        <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
        <p>
          A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject
          to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent
          you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the

          Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to
          object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
        </h3>
        <p>
          IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR
          (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING
          OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE
          SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE
          PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF
          DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU
          LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL
          DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION
          WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR
          INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS

          PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
        </p>
        <p>

          DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING
          PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).

        <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
        <p>
          In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to
          log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member
          state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at
          the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a
          complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court
          proceedings available as legal recourses.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we
          automatically process on the basis of your consent or in order to
          fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a commonly
          used, machine readable format. If you should demand the direct
          transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if
          it is technically feasible.
        </p>
        <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
        <p>
          Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the
          right to at any time demand information about your archived personal
          data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the
          processing of your data. You may also have a right to have your data
          rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject
          matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not
          hesitate to contact us at any time.
        </p>
        <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
        <p>
          You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as
          the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may
          contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing
          applies in the following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data
            archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim.
            During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the
            right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal
            data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an
            unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of
            the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of
            this data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
            exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to
            demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data
            instead of its eradication.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your
            rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As
            long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have
            the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal
            data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these
          data – with the exception of their archiving – may be processed only
          subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal
          entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or
          legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by the
          European Union or a member state of the EU.

        <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
        <p>
          For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
          content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the
          website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
          program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether
          the address line of the browser switches from “http://” to “https://”
          and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us
          cannot be read by third parties.

        <h2>4. Recording of data on this website</h2>
        <h3>Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax</h3>
        <p>
          If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including
          all resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and
          processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not
          pass these data on without your consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your
          inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is required for
          the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
          data are processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the
          effective handling of inquiries submitted to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or
          on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has been
          obtained; the consent can be revoked at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until
          you request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the
          purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your
          request). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory
          retention periods - remain unaffected.
